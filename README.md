# atlas-unity
## Description
A project made for Atlas School Tulsa that showcases my total knowledge on the Unity 2021, Unity 2022, and Unity 6 versions of the Unity engine. Projects demonstrate the following technical knowledge...
- User Interface implementation
- Manipulation of kinematic objects with Unity's built-in physics engine
- Responsive Game audio
- Character model animation
- Environments and world building
- Script engineering
- Linear Algebra, Applied Physics, and Geometry

...through the implementation of a 3D Platformer experience

## Builds
Builds will be made available for each stage of the 3D Platformer's development as the project reaches it's final stages. I intend to have Windows builds in the future, so stay tuned!

# Technical Challenges
- Learning the math behind systems like the coordinate plane, physics calculations, vector manipulation and comparison, and the like, were vital to this project's success.
- Learning what makes a good gaming experience (either with audio being not too harsh or loud, controls being smooth and intuitive, and user interfacing being seamless and informative) required a lot of outside testing, so I had to coordinate testing with friends and family
- Learning how to write scripts using both styleguides and principles like SOLID stretched me and helped me to consistently design good systems before they were even translated into code

# Future Development Actions
- Windows build of the finalized platformer experience
- Build published to itch.io
